Users can select desired tournaments dataset, clustering algorithms, and clustering metrics they want to use. Once optimized clustering result is obtained for the underliying selections, then the cluster data can be downloaded to their local folder.

PGA stats data is scrapred from PGA website: (https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html)

Several clustering machine learning algorithms are available in the app.

The clusteirng datasets contain players PGA stats data combined with their profile data, such as height, weight, age and their world rank according to the World Golf Ranking (http://www.owgr.com/).
