# Golf Players Clustering Rshiny Web App

This repo contains Rshiny web app that allows users to cluster golf players data of various tournaments. Users can select desired tournaments dataset, clustering algorithms, and clustering metrics they want to use. Once optimized clustering result is obtained for the underliying selections, then the cluster data can be downloaded to their local folder.

PGA stats data is scrapred from PGA website: (https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html)

Several clustering machine learning algorithms are available in the app, which can be applied on the Tournament datasets.

The clusteirng datasets contain players PGA stats data combined with their profile data, such as height, weight, age and their world rank based on the World Golf Ranking (http://www.owgr.com/). 

Note: Tournament Dataset folder, Server and User Interface files must be in the same folder. Furthermore, the user must have a prior understanding of the clusteirng algorightms to to get an optimized clustered data efficiently.
